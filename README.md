# Showcase of jupiter notebook projects

These are sample jupiter notebooks based on DataCamp projects that serve to showcase some examples of data exploration and machine learning with Python. 
Notebooks are provided without the datasets that were used in their creation, as there is always a snapshot of the data itself in the notebooks.
